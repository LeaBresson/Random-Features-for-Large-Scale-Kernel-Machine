## Content
A. Rahimi and B. Recht proposed in 2007 ("*Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines*") a very innovative approach for accelerating the training of kernel machines: they map the input data to a randomized low dimensional feature space so that large scale dataset can be solved using linear methods. To do so, they approximate the kernel function using Random Fourier Features or Random Binning Features. The aim of this report is to assess the empirical efficiency of such an approach.
